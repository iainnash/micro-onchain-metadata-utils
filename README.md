# Âµ on-chain metadata utils

### Features:

1. on-chain base-64 encoding for any content type
2. on-chain json builder (supports arrays, nested content).
3. re-exports openzeppelin strings support

this is the spiritual successor of `https://github.com/ourzora/nft-editions/blob/main/contracts/IPublicSharedMetadata.sol` the public shared metadata renderer libraries within `nft-editions`.

This project may be exported and deployed on-chain as a registry, but for now is being offered in library form.
